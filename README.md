## 1. Introduction.
<img src="bitnami.png" height="110">
Bitnami is a library of installers or software packages for web applications and solution stacks as well as virtual appliances. Bitnami is sponsored by Bitrock, a company founded in 2003 in Seville, Spain by Daniel Lopez Ridruejo and Erica Brescia. Bitnami stacks are used for installing software on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X and Solaris. VMware acquired Bitnami on May 15th, 2019.
<br /><br />
The distinct difference between installation of Bitnami installers and native installs (e.g. rpms and debs on Linux) are that they are installed in a way as to prevent interference with existing software and libraries. If multiple applications are installed on the same web server considerations for resolving conflicts on specific ports must be made.
